generations:
  - name: "First Generation (ED)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The original Kia Ceed (spelled cee'd until 2018) was developed specifically for the European market as Kia's first serious competitor in the crucial C-segment. Designed at Kia's European design center in Frankfurt, Germany, and manufactured in Slovakia, it represented Kia's commitment to becoming a mainstream player in Europe. Available in three body styles: five-door hatchback, three-door hatchback (pro_cee'd), and station wagon (cee'd SW). Engine options included four engines (two petrol and two diesel), with three trim levels (LX, EX, TX). A facelift in September 2009 introduced Kia's distinctive 'tiger nose' grille. Approximately 646,300 units were produced. This generation established the Ceed as Kia's European cornerstone model, helping to transform the brand's image from a budget alternative to a legitimate competitor for mainstream brands like Volkswagen, Ford, and Opel/Vauxhall."

  - name: "Second Generation (JD)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The second-generation Ceed featured more sophisticated styling under the direction of Peter Schreyer, with the distinctive 'tiger nose' grille and more dynamic proportions. Making its worldwide premiere at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, it was significantly more expensive than the first generation and moved the Ceed out of the 'budget' market. Available in the same three body styles as its predecessor, plus the addition of the Proceed GT as a performance-oriented variant (first hot hatch from Kia, released July 2013 for 3-door, January 2014 for 5-door). A facelift was shown in June 2015 and went on sale in September 2015. Approximately 647,700 units were produced. Engine options evolved to include more efficient and refined units, including new direct-injection gasoline engines and improved diesels. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology."

  - name: "Third Generation (CD)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2026
    description: "The current Ceed (now with simplified spelling) was announced in February 2018 and revealed at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show. Production of the hatchback started in May 2018 with availability from June 2018. Features more mature styling with clean lines and sophisticated detailing under Peter Schreyer's direction. Available in various body styles including five-door hatchback, station wagon (Ceed SW), shooting brake (ProCeed launched early 2019), and crossover-inspired variant (XCeed unveiled September 2019). Built on Kia's new K2 platform, it offers improved driving dynamics, refinement, and safety. A 48-volt mild hybrid diesel engine variant (EcoDynamics+) was added for the entire lineup in 2020. The interior represents a major step forward with a more premium design, higher quality materials, and advanced technology including a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and comprehensive connectivity features. Safety technology has advanced significantly with Kia's DriveWise suite. This generation competes directly with established European models like the Volkswagen Golf on quality and features while maintaining Kia's value proposition and industry-leading 7-year warranty."
