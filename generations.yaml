generations:
  - name: "First Generation (ED)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The original Kia Ceed (spelled cee'd until 2018) was developed specifically for the European market as Kia's first serious competitor in the crucial C-segment. Designed at Kia's European design center in Germany and manufactured in Slovakia, it represented Kia's commitment to becoming a mainstream player in Europe. Available in three body styles: five-door hatchback, three-door hatchback (pro_cee'd), and station wagon (cee'd SW). Engine options typically included various gasoline and diesel four-cylinders ranging from 1.4L to 2.0L, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior offered good space and practicality, though materials and design were relatively basic compared to established European competitors. This generation established the Ceed as Kia's European cornerstone model, helping to transform the brand's image from a budget alternative to a legitimate competitor for mainstream brands like Volkswagen, Ford, and Opel/Vauxhall."

    description: "The second-generation Ceed featured more sophisticated styling under the direction of Peter Schreyer, with the distinctive 'tiger nose' grille and more dynamic proportions. Available in the same three body styles as its predecessor, plus the addition of the Proceed GT as a performance-oriented variant. Engine options evolved to include more efficient and refined units, including new direct-injection gasoline engines and improved diesels. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, offering features like touchscreen infotainment, automatic climate control, and advanced safety systems. This generation elevated the Ceed's status from value-oriented alternative to a fully competitive European C-segment contender, with quality and features approaching those of the segment leaders while maintaining a price advantage."

    end_year: null
    description: "The current Ceed (now with simplified spelling) features more mature styling with clean lines and sophisticated detailing. Available in various body styles including five-door hatchback, station wagon (Ceed SW), shooting brake (ProCeed), and crossover-inspired variant (XCeed). Built on Kia's new K2 platform, it offers improved driving dynamics, refinement, and safety. Engine options include efficient gasoline and diesel units, plus mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains in later models, reflecting the industry's shift toward electrification. The interior represents a major step forward with a more premium design, higher quality materials, and advanced technology including a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, and comprehensive connectivity features. Safety technology has advanced significantly with Kia's DriveWise suite including features like autonomous emergency braking, lane keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. This generation competes directly with established European models like the Volkswagen Golf on quality and features while maintaining Kia's value proposition and industry-leading 7-year warranty, positioning the Ceed as a mainstream rather than budget alternative in the European C-segment."
